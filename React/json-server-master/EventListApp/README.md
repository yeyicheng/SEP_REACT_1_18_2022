### Hintsï¼š

> **1**: When user click on the "ADD NEW" button, add a new row of event with empty input for each entry at the end of the list

> **2**: When user click on the "SAVE" button, new event will be stored to the json-server and reflected on the front-end page. Front-end should validate the input data before saving the event.

> **3**: When user click on the "EDIT" button, corresponding row of event should become editable. Each entry becomes an input with current value as default input.

> **4**: Entry 'Start Date' and 'End Date' of each event should be stored in string format on the database. You can use 'Epoch time'(ref link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime). Making sure you can convert those string into human-readable information and display on the front-end event list, e.g., '12-18-2021'.

> **5**: You can use html built-in 'date picker' (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date) to collect the date input data.
